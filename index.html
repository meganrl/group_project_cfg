<p> Welcome to Bates Bakes! Anna Bates is a finalist at the University of Cambridge, where she studies Economics.
  Combining her business-oriented skillset with her passion for baking, Anna now has over a decade of experience behind her
  and has perfected the "Bates bake". Anna accepts custom requests for all celebrations, birthdays, weddings and the like.
  As cakes are made to order, prices vary with each bake. However, Anna does provide a guideline price in order to give customers an idea of the cost. </p>
